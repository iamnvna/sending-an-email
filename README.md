### Project Twelve - 100DaysOfCode
# Sending An Email
This is a simple program collects the appropriate inputs and sends out an email to a recipient.

## Background
This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode learning streak. I intend to write a simple python program each day. Each project would:
* be heavily commented for learning purposes;
* include a README file similar to this one;
* include an algorithm to solve it without code;
* include a summary of what I learnt.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Import the appropriate library(s).
3. Collect the required inputs to send an email: sender email, subject, message, and recipient email.
4. Collect the login password to the senders email.
5. Apply the syntax from the modules/libraries imported to send out the mail. Be aware of:
* the mail protocol used by the sender email client
* the accuracy of the password to the sender email
* the protective measures or security used by the sender email as some automatically block sending out emails from third party applications.
6. Print appropriate output to tell if the email being sent was successful or not.
7. Stop.

## What I've learnt
* This program was my first introduction to the modules in python.
* I explored more the use of input() statements.
* Writing algorithms is tough when you are using libraries because your algorithm isn't language specific.
* This program also taught me how to find information when you get stack.
